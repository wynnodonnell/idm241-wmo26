            For this project I want to create a microinteraction where when a user hovers over one of my projects that I have worked on they get more details about the project. Currently it is just an image and a link to the projects, but I want to make it so that the user can see information about the project just by hovering.
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="text3">Trigger:</p>
            <p class="text2">The trigger takes place when the user hovers over the image of one of my projects. When the mouse moves away from the image the microinteraction ends.</p>
            <p class="text3">Rules:</p>
            <p class="text2">When the user hovers over the image of one of my projects the image will get larger, and some text will appear bellow it to explain what the project is. when the user moves their mouse away the image will go back to it's normal size and the text will disappear.</p>
            <p class="text3">Feedback:</p>
            <p class="text2">The user will get feedback that a microinteraction is happening when they see that the image gets larger when they hover over it, and that text appears.</p>
            <p class="text3">Modes and Loops:</p>
            <p class="text2">There are no modes or loops in this microinteraction.</p>
