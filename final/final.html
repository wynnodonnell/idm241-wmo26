            <p class="text3">Trigger(s):</p>
            <p class="text2"> The first Trigger for this microinteraction is the clicking of the icon, this is what I did during the Beta.
                The second Trigger for this microinteraction is the hoverstate that will happen when you hover over any of the links or buttons present in the Beta Build.
            </p>
            <p class="text3">Rules:</p>
            <p class="text2">When the user hovers over any of the menu icons or links within the menu a change will occur, for the links within the menu there will be a color change in their background, and they will become slightly larger, pushing everything else away. </p>
            <p class="text3">Feedback:</p>
            <p class="text2">The user will know the microinteraction is happening when they see the changes that happen during the hoverstate.</p>
            <p class="text3">Modes and Loops:</p>
            <p class="text2">There are two modes for this microinteraction that were included in the beta. The first is the open state, and the second is the closed state. There is also a loop present in this microinteraction, as when the user hovers over the close or open icon for the menu the icon will animate back and forth between the two.</p>
