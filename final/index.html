            For the final project I want to continue a microinteraction that I worked on for the beta.
            <ul>
                <li>In the Beta I created an interaction for the menu opening and closing</li>
                <li>For the final I want to refine what I created in the beta by adding hoverstate interactions for the menu items and the menu buttons.</li>
                <li>I also want to integrate this into my portfolio website, and make it reponsive so it works on mobile iPad and Desktop.</li>
            </ul>
            I plan on doing this using a combination of CSS, HTML, and Javascript.
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="text3">Trigger(s):</p>
            <p class="text2"> The first Trigger for this microinteraction is the clicking of the icon, this is what I did during the Beta.
                The second Trigger for this microinteraction is the hoverstate that will happen when you hover over any of the links or buttons present in the Beta Build.
            </p>
            <p class="text3">Rules:</p>
            <p class="text2">When the user hovers over any of the menu icons or links within the menu a change will occur, for the links within the menu there will be a color change in their background, and they will become slightly larger, pushing everything else away. For the hoverstate on the icon I want the icon to have an animation between the X and the three lines, and I want this to play when the user hovers over it.</p>
            <p class="text3">Feedback:</p>
            <p class="text2">The user will know the microinteraction is happening when they see the changes that happen during the hoverstate.</p>
            <p class="text3">Modes and Loops:</p>
            <p class="text2">There are two modes for this microinteraction that were included in the beta. The first is the open state, and the second is the closed state. There is also a loop present in this microinteraction, as when the user hovers over the close or open icon for the menu the icon will animate back and forth between the two.</p>
